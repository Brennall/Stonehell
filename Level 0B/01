[FFFFFF]The Concealing Copse:[-] Stands of elm, maple & oak trees; ground thick with loam & fallen leaves. This copse of trees bears a faded enchantment from long ago.

Many years ago, a magic-user placed this grove of trees under a massmorph spell to conceal a body of soldiers. The magic-user and his men are long gone but the enchantment remains, albeit faded by the passage of time. Anyone entering this copse will assume the illusionary appearance of a tree, becoming undetectable by normal means to anyone outside of the grove. The brigands that lurk near Stonehell are aware of this enchantment and use the copse to spy upon and ambush parties as they enter and leave the dungeon. There is a 2 in 6 chance that 2d4 Brigands will be lurking in the woods at any given time. Depending on their numbers and the partyâ€˜s apparent strength and wealth, the brigands may attack or merely observe the party with the intent to ambush them at a later time.
