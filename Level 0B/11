[FFFFFF]Rabid Raccoon:[-] Bare walls; adventurer litter (expended torches, rusty iron spikes, frayed rope, etc). A frothing, [DA1A18]rabid Raccoon (stats as Giant Rat)[-] has come here to die. It is dangerous to approach and its bite will cause the victim to contract rabies if a save vs. poison at a +3 bonus is failed.
