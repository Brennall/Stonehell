[FFFFFF]Interview Room:[-] Stone throne covered with adventurers‘ graffiti; broken tiled floor; dust & cobwebs. An open trapdoor leads to a pit (20‘ deep and studded with rusty spikes) set into the floor before the throne. A button on the throne‘s left armrest once triggered the pit trap, but the mechanism is now broken. The secret door in the north wall is of shoddy workmanship (+1 bonus to attempts to find it).
