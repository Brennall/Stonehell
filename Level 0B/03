[FFFFFF]Ruined Building:[-] Remains of stone walls & rotted timbers; thick growths of weeds; piles of fallen leaves. 

In the empty ruins of this building lies a buried cache of riches. There is no obvious indication that the ground has been disturbed, as the hoard was buried long ago. Only through luck or magical detection will this cache be discovered. If the Labyrinth Lord wishes, he may use this location as the resting place of a treasure indicated by one of the treasure maps discovered within the halls of Stonehell. Otherwise, 1,000 gp worth of mixed coins have been buried here.
