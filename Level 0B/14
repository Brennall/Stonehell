[FFFFFF]Trapped Room:[-] Stout wooden door (obviously of new construction). Door is unlocked, but trapped. [DA1A18]Opening it causes a sand-filled burlap sack, suspended on a rope, to swing into the doorway and possibly (2 in 6 chance) strike the character opening the door for 1d4 points of damage. Additionally, there is a 1 in 6 chance the sack will break the victim‘s nose if he‘s not wearing a helmet.[-] This relatively-harmless trap was set here by the kobold work crews as cheap entertainment. Any PC with a broken nose who encounters the kobolds of Stonehell will find that the scaly humanoids point and snicker at him when they think he‘s not looking. The room beyond the door is bare and empty of treasure.
