[FFFFFF]Hell’s Entrance Hall:[-] Graffiti-covered walls and a bare, well-worn floor; ceiling arches 30‘ overhead; spiral staircase descends down a hole in the center of the floor. The graffiti consists of names of adventurers who have come this way and messages written in Kobold (i.e., Clean up trash, dumb men!). The spiral stairs descend 100‘ down before emerging from the ceiling of area #1 on Level 1A (p. 30)
