[FFFFFF]Secret Chamber:[-] Massive (15‘ × 10‘) stone table; wrecked shelving; litter and debris. This room has been picked over time and time again. However, a small secret compartment in one of the table‘s legs has been overlooked. This cavity contains 50 sp, a potion of extra-healing, and a ring of the scintillating orb (see New Magical Item p. 19).
